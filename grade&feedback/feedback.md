# Thank you for your submission Sam!

You have done a fantastic job on this assignment completing all of the requirements as well as completing some extra stretch goals! You have error pages, user authentication, user profiles, posts, ways for users to edit and delete their posts, utilizing a radix accordion and have3 styled the site really nicely with a combination of tailwind and other techniques!

## Next Steps:

- Tailwind can definitely be overwhelming but one extension that makes it easier for me to use it is this [Tailwind Fold](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=stivo.tailwind-fold) This collapeses the className while your Text Cursor isn't in its contents.

- Look at validating and where you validate, for example it would be better to validate the user before redirecting them to edit and delete endpoints rather than redirecting and then redirecting back. This concept can also be used on forms but keep in mind that validating data in the server is an important concepts it ensures validity as clients can be manipulated.

- While I can completely understand the pain of git conflicts especially on small changes it is very valuable to be able to easily and quickly fixit through git and to also understand why and what you are doing with git.

Overall you have done really well this week and should be proud of overcoming this task! You have completed all the requirements and shown a fantastic understanding of the topics taking lots onboard and realising that some docs are just awful to work with! I am giving you an 8/8!
